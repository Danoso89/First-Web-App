# First Web App

This is an app created with the purpose of learning.

### First step - Week 1

As of 04 August 2016, it receives a Github user name, and fetch the account's data from Github public API. The app stores part of that info at the local storage, and print the same information formated.

For this part I have used:  
* Jquery
* Closures
* Module Patter
* API call
